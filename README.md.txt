# Statistics Repository

## Overview
This repository contains four assignments from my statistics coursework at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The assignments apply various statistical concepts such as Markov chains, equilibrium distributions, and eigenanalysis, using real-world scenarios.

## Contents

### Mini Project: Markov Chain and Pool Players
**Description:** This project explores a Markov chain model based on a pool game scenario involving three players. It uses stochastic processes to determine which players compete most frequently in the long run. The analysis involves constructing a one-step transition matrix and performing eigenanalysis to find the equilibrium distribution of player matchups.

### Project 1
This project focuses on analyzing the relationship between smoking behavior and mortality rates using data from a 20-year follow-up study conducted on women. The data explores the influence of smoking and age on mortality, introducing key concepts such as observational studies, confounding factors (CF), and Simpson's Paradox. The project involves calculating probabilities to determine associations between smoking habits, mortality rates, and age groups. By controlling for age, the project demonstrates how confounding variables can affect perceived relationships in data. The study emphasizes the importance of considering external variables when drawing conclusions in statistical analysis.

### Project 2
This project tackles advanced probability and statistical concepts using examples such as the Exchange Paradox and joint, marginal, and conditional densities. The Exchange Paradox problem challenges the flawed reasoning that always trading envelopes is advantageous, using Bayesian decision theory to correct the logic. Another key section of the project includes practicing with continuous random vectors and transformations, leading to the calculation of joint distributions and conditional expectations. The project also explores moment-generating functions for Binomial and Poisson distributions to understand skewness. Lastly, an archaeological case study involving the Pareto distribution is used to estimate species extinction through Bayesian analysis.

### Project 3
This project focuses on understanding the impact of measurement error in pH levels of freshwater lakes and examines the effects of Captopril on blood pressure in hypertensive patients. The work is divided into two main problems: the first involves limnological studies and measurement error, while the second addresses clinical trials concerning hypertension treatment.
